Compilers are notorious for their obscure error messages like 
“not a statement” that leave us wondering what they mean. JAVA is the most widely used language for
teaching and learning introductory programming, and most students and teachers
use the Sun SDK (System Development Kit) either directly or indirectly through a
development environment like BlueJ or DrJava. The error messages produced by
this compiler are terse and many novices find it difficult to achieve even syntactically
correct programs. This document provided with this <a href="/files/errors.pdf">
link </a> is a guide to understanding and fixing errors in JAVA. This would be useful for novice Java
Developer for their learning process. Thank you.
