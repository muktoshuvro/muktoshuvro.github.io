<p class="lead" align="justify">Compilers are notorious for their obscure error messages like “not a statement” that
leave you wondering what they mean. JAVA is the most widely used language for
teaching and learning introductory programming, and most students and teachers
use the Sun SDK (System Development Kit) either directly or indirectly through a
development environment like BlueJ or DrJava. The error messages produced by
this compiler are terse and many novices find it difficult to achieve even syntactically
correct programs. This document is a guide to understanding and fixing errors in
JAVA. Chapter 2 lists the error messages from the compiler and describes typical
mistakes that give rise to them. Chapter 3 does the same for runtime exceptions.
Chapter 4 is a short discussion of equality and assignment in JAVA, while Chapter 5
presents ways of debugging without the use of a debugger.
The ECLIPSE development environment has its own compiler for JAVA. While the
environment is not as elementary as those intended for novices, it has much to recommend
it—even in introductory courses—because of its superior error messages
and its support for identifying and correcting syntax errors. The compiler is incremental
meaning that it checks the correctness of your program as you type. ECLIPSE
error message are different from those of the Sun SDK and will be presented alongside
them.
If you doubt that an error message is correct, you can consult the formal definition of
the JAVA language which is contained in the book The Java Language Specification by
James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy L. Steele Jr. and Gilad Bracha. It can also be downloaded
from <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/index.html"> here </a>.
