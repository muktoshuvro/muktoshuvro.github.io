				<p>
My name is Sabbir Ahmad. I was born and raised in Chandpur, an extremely smallest city of a tiny south asian nation, Bangladesh. Completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology, one the most coveted undergraduate institue in the country. And now, I've moved to a beautiful small port side town of Bremen, Germany, one of the smallest state city in North-Western Germany and almost finished with my Master in Digital Media in University of Bremen.<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
